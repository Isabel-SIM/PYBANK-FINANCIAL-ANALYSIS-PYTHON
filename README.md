# PyBank Financial Analysis with Python

In this Python script, we analyse the financial records of a company provided in the `budget_data.csv` dataset. This dataset consists of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. Using Python, we calculate various financial metrics to gain insights into the company's financial performance.

## Before You Begin

1. Create a new GitHub repository called `python-homework`.

2. Clone the repository to your computer.

3. Organize your repository by creating two directories: `PyBank` and `PyRamen`.

4. In the `PyBank` directory, add a Jupyter Notebook file named `main.ipynb`. This will be the main notebook for running the PyBank analysis.

5. Push these changes to your GitHub repository.

## PyBank Analysis

### Overview

In the PyBank analysis, we aim to calculate the following financial metrics:

1. **Total Months:** Calculate the total number of months included in the dataset.

2. **Net Total:** Calculate the net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

3. **Average Change:** Calculate the average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

4. **Greatest Increase:** Identify the month and amount of the greatest increase in profits over the entire period.

5. **Greatest Decrease:** Identify the month and amount of the greatest decrease in losses over the entire period.



### How to Run the Analysis

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Isabel-SIM/WEEK-TWO-HOMEWORK.git

2. Navigate to the 'PyBank' directory:
  cd python-homework/PyBank

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
  jupyter notebook main.ipynb

4. Run the cells in the Jupyter Notebook to execute the PyBank analysis.

5. The analysis results will be printed in the notebook and exported to a text file named financial_analysis.txt.
